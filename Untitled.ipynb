Bedrooms are really nice and most are huge, 6 are doubles and 1 decent sized single. The two bathrooms are okay but the upstairs one has a real problem with mould and the water from the shower goes everywhere, which Mr Burton insisted on blaming us for, and leaks through to the dining room below causing some mould problems there. 2 bedrooms on the 3rd floor are double glazed so stay warm but other rooms are very cold due to thin windows and the heating system is a little variable (some radiators are very hot whilst others don�t work). The kitchen is tiny for 7 people with a very old cooker and a dishwasher that doesn�t work. The dining room has a decent amount of storage for cooking stuff. There is no living room as that has been converted into an extra bedroom. Mr Burton is a very difficult landlord and doesn�t get much done and when he does come to the house will try and blame everything on you. He does have quite low standards however so we got all our deposit back. The house isn�t professionally cleaned between tenants so the state you receive the house in depends on how clean the previous tenants left it. Mr Burton does however insist that all tenants pay for carpet cleaning at the end of their stay so they are the most well kept part of the house. \"\n",

Don't really have a living room but have a basement which is perfect for predrinks and useful for storage.  Bathroom is huge and really nice.  One of the neighbours takes care of the garden and plants flowers etc (although her dog also poos in it).  House is generally in pretty good condition, bit of damp around but nothing too major.  The worst thing is the extremely poor insulation - it can get very cold and the house loses heat easily.  Also had a rat at some point. The walls are also super thin so you can hear everything the neighbours say/do.  The two front larger bedrooms also only have single glazing which is cold and noisy, and is causing damp in one of the rooms.  At the moment the boiler has been playing up but it's hopefully being sorted - the landlord has been really good about this.  Parking permits do technically come with the house but you have to get them from Premier and they are pretty useless about most things. \r",

Bedrooms are really nice and most are huge, 6 are doubles and 1 decent sized single. The two bathrooms are okay but the upstairs one has a real problem with mould and the water from the shower goes everywhere, which Mr Burton insisted on blaming us for, and leaks through to the dining room below causing some mould problems there. 2 bedrooms on the 3rd floor are double glazed so stay warm but other rooms are very cold due to thin windows and the heating system is a little variable (some radiators are very hot whilst others don’t work). The kitchen is tiny for 7 people with a very old cooker and a dishwasher that doesn’t work. The dining room has a decent amount of storage for cooking stuff. There is no living room as that has been converted into an extra bedroom. Mr Burton is a very difficult landlord and doesn’t get much done and when he does come to the house will try and blame everything on you. He does have quite low standards however so we got all our deposit back. The house isn’t professionally cleaned between tenants so the state you receive the house in depends on how clean the previous tenants left it. Mr Burton does however insist that all tenants pay for carpet cleaning at the end of their stay so they are the most well kept part of the house. \r",
